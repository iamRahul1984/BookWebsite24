                Five years ago, Court Gentry was the CIA’s best covert asset. Then, without warning, his masters at the Agency put him at the top of their kill list. Court fled his country and became an enigmatic killer for hire known as the Gray Man.

               ​Mark Greaney, born on October 25, 1967, in Memphis, Tennessee, is a renowned American novelist specializing in thriller and war fiction genres. He gained prominence through his collaboration with Tom Clancy, co-authoring several novels in the Jack Ryan universe and continuing the series after Clancy's passing in 2013. Greaney is also the creator of the Gray Man series, which has been adapted into a Netflix film starring Ryan Gosling and Chris Evans. Holding degrees in political science and international relations, Greaney's academic background enriches his writing with authentic geopolitical insights.
