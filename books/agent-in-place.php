                Fresh off his first mission back with the CIA, Court Gentry secures what seems like a cut-and-dried contract job: A group of expats in Paris hires him to kidnap the mistress of Syrian dictator Ahmed Azzam to get intel that could destabilize Azzam's regime.

Court delivers Bianca Medina to the rebels, but his job doesn't end there. She soon reveals that she has given birth to a son, the only heir to Azzam's rule--and a potent threat to the Syrian president's powerful wife.

Now, to get Bianca's cooperation, Court must bring her son out of Syria alive.

               â€‹Mark Greaney, born on October 25, 1967, in Memphis, Tennessee, is a renowned American novelist specializing in thriller and war fiction genres. He gained prominence through his collaboration with Tom Clancy, co-authoring several novels in the Jack Ryan universe and continuing the series after Clancy's passing in 2013. Greaney is also the creator of the Gray Man series, which has been adapted into a Netflix film starring Ryan Gosling and Chris Evans. Holding degrees in political science and international relations, Greaney's academic background enriches his writing with authentic geopolitical insights. His commitment to realism is evident in his extensive research, including traveling to over 35 countries and training in firearms, battlefield medicine, and close-quarters combat. Residing in Memphis with his wife Allison and three stepchildren, Greaney continues to contribute significantly to the thriller genre with his compelling narratives and well-researched plots.
