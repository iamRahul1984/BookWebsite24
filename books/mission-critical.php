                <article>
                Court Gentry's flight on a CIA transport plane is interrupted when a security team brings a hooded man aboard. They want to kick Gentry off the flight but are overruled by CIA headquarters. The mystery man is being transported to England where a joint CIA/MI6 team will interrogate him about a mole in Langley.

When they land in an isolated airbase in the U.K., they are attacked by a hostile force who kidnaps the prisoner. Only Gentry escapes. His handlers send him after the attackers, but what can one operative do against a trained team of assassins? A lot, when that operative is the Gray Man.

               â€‹Mark Greaney, born on October 25, 1967, in Memphis, Tennessee, is a renowned American novelist specializing in thriller and war fiction genres. He gained prominence through his collaboration with Tom Clancy, co-authoring several novels in the Jack Ryan universe and continuing the series after Clancy's passing in 2013. Greaney is also the creator of the Gray Man series, which has been adapted into a Netflix film starring Ryan Gosling and Chris Evans. Holding degrees in political science and international relations, Greaney's academic background enriches his writing with authentic geopolitical insights. His commitment to realism is evident in his extensive research, including traveling to over 35 countries and training in firearms, battlefield medicine, and close-quarters combat. Residing in Memphis with his wife Allison and three stepchildren, Greaney continues to contribute significantly to the thriller genre with his compelling narratives and well-researched plots.
